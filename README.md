# email_list

The objective of this project was to work with event handler and understand in practice how it works. Below is a list of the things that I did on this project working with event handler:
1. event handler for the click event to the “Clear Entries” button that clears all of the text boxes by setting them to an empty string(“”). 
2.The same event handler should also put the asterisks back in the span elements that are displayed to the right of the text boxes to show that entries are required. 
3.Add one statement to this event handler that moves the focus to the first text box.
4.Add another event handler to this application for the double-click event of any text box. This should empty this specific text box and put an asterisk back next to it.
5.Validate that the email address with a regular expression and validate that the first name is at least two or more non-whitespace characters.
